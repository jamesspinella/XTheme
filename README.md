# Xtheme

A Sketch template for quickly and easily designing new themes for Xcode.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjust fonts and colors and immediately see each change in sample code so you'll know how your color and font combinations actually look in the wild.
  
NOTE: Xcode Theme colors are in RGBA Decimal format, and often go to as many as six (6) decimal places. It's best to paste in color codes from Sketch into Xcode's Colors & Fonts when editing and creating themes, rather than pasting in values directly to .dvtcolortheme (Xcode theme) files.  
  
  
And hey, some Xcode themes!
---------------------------

**Specials Board** - Based on Coda's Specials Board theme.  
**Jatsby** - Based on the Jatsby Web Framework's color palette.  
  
*More themes to come in future releases!*
